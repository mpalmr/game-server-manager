# Game Server Manager

## Purpose

This is my first open source project I'm committing to GitHub in a while. The three primary purposes of this project is to:

1. Showcase my abilities as I've been working primarily on a closed source project in my off time.
1. Develop something to help people remotely manage their VPSs containing game servers so they don't have to purchase a server for each game.
1. Learn [electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/).


## What is it?

An electron.js application that remotely manages specific game server docker containers. Features planned:

- GUI for deploying and managing docker containers as well as game settings for:
  - Factorio
  - Satisfactory
  - Valheim
  - More&hellip;?
- Mapping individual containers to specific servers so people can manage more than a single server
- SSH terminal
